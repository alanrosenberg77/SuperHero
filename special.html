                    In the event of a blood moon, the Wanderer transforms from her usual, unassuming appearance. Her eyes darken to a devilish shade of red, and her skin turns to a lifeless pale. Formerly invisible facial markings begin to glow, and an ensignia of the moon burns on her forehead. Her appearance reflects the power of the full fury of the night.

                    Her magic is heightened to its maximum. What spells she would have cast are now amplified to have double their original potency. She is less detectable, more elusive, less controllable, and more lethal. The Wanderer is virtually unstoppable in the presence of a blood moon.
