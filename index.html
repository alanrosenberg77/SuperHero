			One with the night, stronger than the tides, and more deadly than a dire wolf.
			The Wanderer is a fierce sorcerous, drawing her power from the night and phase
			of the moon. Blessed by a diety, she is destined to topple a system of oppression
			that has terrorized the populous of this once great nation; a system that had
			stolen the crown from her ancestors and slaughtered them.
		</p>
		<p>
			Only with the power of the Wanderer do the people stand a chance of revolting
			against their tyrant. She has worked to carefully pick apart the usurper's
			government, bringing cruel figures to justice, but she has yet to face her biggest
			challenge: reclaiming the throne for her family.
