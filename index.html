			<h1>The Wanderer</h1>
			<div>
				<p>
					One with the night, stronger than the tides, and more deadly than a dire wolf. The Wanderer is a fierce sorcerous, drawing her power from the night and phase of the moon. Blessed by a diety, she is destined to topple a system of oppression that has terrorized the populous of this once great nation; a system that had stolen the crown from her ancestors and slaughtered them.
				</p>
				<p>
					Only with the power of the Wanderer do the people stand a chance of revolting against their tyrant. She has worked to carefully pick apart the usurper's government, bringing cruel figures to justice, but she has yet to face her biggest challenge: reclaiming the throne for her family.
