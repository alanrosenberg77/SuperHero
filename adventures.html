					<h3>The Coup of Angleton</h3>

					<p>
						The town of Angleton was governed by a man named (insert evil british name). He appointed a
						corrupt judge, and the two rigged all court cases. The jail filled so quickly that new convicts
						were hanged. Angleton lived in a constant state of fear. The Wanderer caught wind of this
						tyranny, and swiftly made her way to Angleton.
					</p>
					<p>
						Upon her arrival, the Wanderer investigated the governor's mansion, studying points of egress.
						She scouted the town, looking for someone fit to govern Angleton, someone virtuous. She happened
						upon a man destined for the gallows. She heard his story: his son had gotten in trouble with a
						policeman, nothing more serious than being out past curfew. The man defended his son, taking the
						blame. He was arrested, his charges exaggerated, and his sentence given. The Wanderer took pity
						and freed him by distracting the courthouse guards.
					</p>
					<p>
						With the might of the night and the light of the moon, the Wanderer infitrated the governor's
						mansion. She dashed through hallways, evaded guards, and circumvented defenses. She used her
						superhuman speed in combination with stealthy acrobatics to maneuver through the mansion. If
						she was discovered, she silenced her enemies quickly and silently. Within minutes, she had
						isolated the governor.
					</p>
					<p>
						The next day the townspeople were gathered around the mansion. Bruised and tied up on the
						doorstep was the formerly untouchable governor. Word on the block was that the judge had gone
						missing too. Suddenly, the system of fear was dismantled, and the people rejoiced. A man emerged
						from the mansion and he began to tell the people a story: it was a story of how he was forced to
						trade places with his son to keep him out of the gallows, but that he was freed by a mysterious
						woman, and was told to lead the city out of darkness. As the Angletonians accepted the man as
						their new governor, the Wanderer smirked from afar, then vanished.

					<h3>Jexton Fireworks</h3>

				</div>
				<div>
					<p>
						Jexton is a military installation of the Andorian Kingdom. The base is stocked with enough
						weapons, armor, and explosives to equip a third of the Andorian army. It had been the Wanderer's
						top target since she charted it in her family's cartography shop. Her usual style is to
						infiltrate using stealth and carefully, methodically dismantle defenses as she conducts her
						missions. This time, however, she chose a different method.
					</p>
					<p>
						It was a quiet night in Jexton. The streets were empty, most people were asleep, and guards at
						their posts were feeling quite bored. They stared curiously into the full moon, as did the
						Wanderer. She soaked in the moonbeams, feeling quite like a night goddess herself. Her power
						reached a critical point. She focused all her energy and strength, and smote the barracks of
						Jexton, igniting the stocks of gunpowder, and causing massive explosions. The calmness of the
						night had transformed into chaos and hellfire.
					</p>
					<p>
						She surged into action. The Wanderer needed only the silhouette of the soldiers as they
						scattered in front of the inferno to track them down. Once their silhouette disappeared, it
						never reappeared. By the time the barracks had been reduced to embers, the night returned to its
						former peace and quiet. Not a light flickered, not a creature stirred. The only sound was of the
						blood dripping from the cooling bodies. The Wanderer crossed off Jexton from her map.
