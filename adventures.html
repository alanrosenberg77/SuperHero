		<h1>Adventures</h1>
		<h3>The Coup of Angleton</h3>

		<p>
			The town of Angleton was governed by a man named (insert evil british name). He appointed a
			corrupt judge, and the two rigged all court cases. The jail filled so quickly that new convicts
			were hanged. Angleton lived in a constant state of fear. The Wanderer caught wind of this tyranny,
			and swiftly made her way to Angleton.
		</p>
		<p>
			Upon her arrival, the Wanderer investigated the governor's mansion, studying points of egress.
			She scouted the town, looking for someone fit to govern Angleton, someone virtuous. She happened
			upon a man destined for the gallows. She heard his story: his son had gotten in trouble with a
			policeman, nothing more serious than being out past curfew. The man defended his son, taking the
			blame. He was arrested, his charges exaggerated, and his sentence given. The Wanderer took pity
			and freed him by distracting the courthouse guards.
		</p>
		<p>
			With the might of the night and the light of the moon, the Wanderer infitrated the governor's mansion.
			She dashed through hallways, evaded guards, and circumvented defenses. She used her superhuman speed
			in combination with stealthy acrobatics to maneuver through the mansion. If she was discovered, she
			silenced her enemies quickly and silently. Within minutes, she had isolated the governor.
		</p>
		<p>
			The next day the townspeople were gathered around the mansion. Bruised and tied up on the doorstep
			was the formerly untouchable governor. Word on the block was that the judge had gone missing too.
			Suddenly, the system of fear was dismantled, and the people rejoiced. A man emerged from the
			mansion and he began to tell the people a story: it was a story of how he was forced to trade
			places with his son to keep him out of the gallows, but that he was freed by a mysterious woman,
			and was told to lead the city out of darkness.  As the Angletonians accepted the man as their new
			governor, the Wanderer smirked from afar, then vanished.

		<h3>Jexton Fireworks</h3>

		<p>
			Jexton is a military installation of the Andorian Kingdom. The base is stocked with enough weapons,
			armor, and explosives to equip a third of the Andorian army. It had been the Wanderer's top target
			since she charted it in her family's cartography shop. Her usual style is to infiltrate using stealth
			and carefully, methodically dismantle defenses as she conducts her missions. This time, however, she
			chose a different method.
		</p>
		<p>
			It was a quiet night in Jexton. The streets were empty, most people were asleep, and guards at their
			posts were feeling quite bored. They stared curiously into the full moon, as did the Wanderer. She
			soaked in the moonbeams, feeling quite like a night goddess herself. Her power reached a critical
			point. She focused all her energy and strength, and smote the barracks of Jexton, igniting the
			stocks of gunpowder, and causing a massive explosion. The calmness of the night had transformed
			into chaos and hellfire.
		</p>
		<p>
			She surged into action. The Wanderer needed only the silhouette of the soldiers as they scattered
			in front of the inferno to track them down. Once their silhouette disappeared, it never reappeared.
			By the time the barracks had been reduced to embers, the night returned to its former peace and quiet.
			Not a light flickered, not a creature stirred. The only sound was of the blood dripping from the
			cooling bodies.
