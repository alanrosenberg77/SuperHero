		<h1>Biography</h1>
		<p>
			On a distant planet, home to a race of humanoids, exists a powerful kingdom. The kingdom,
			ruled by the Andor family, has its fair share of problems. Its citizens live in poverty,
			and those fortunate enough to live above the poverty line all seem to come from old money
			or dirty money. Police are brutal, politicians apathetic, free speech squashed. Families
			stay within their lines and keep their heads down, but they make ends meet.
			
			One such family is different though. You would never know by looking at them, or even by
			close study. The ___ family is perfectly normal from the outside. Whats on the inside is
			what sets them apart. Invisible to peering eyes is the family's heritage.
			
			Long ago, the Andorian Kingdom was actually the Iyadorian Queendom. The matriarchal society
			was ruled by the Iyador family, who took a more democratic approach to their reign. The family
			was renowned for the attention they paid to the populous. Policies were ratified according to
			the needs of the peoplc. Public projects were constantly in the works to improve infrastucture
			and quality of life. The family battled poverty like no other adversary they had ever faced, yet
			they still faced potent opponents to the crown. Rival factions waged wars against Iyador, but
			always in vain.
			
			A long kept secret of the family was that they were blessed by the diety of the night, who
			granted them unimaginable magical powers which multiplied after the sun set. The blessed family
			members were socerers capable of decimating entire legions singlehandedly. The blessing was not
			a guarentee for all family members, however. The Goddess of the Night selected only female candidates
			that she deemed truly noble and worthy of the power of the night. As such, generations of Iyadors
			may be skipped before another heir is chosen.
			
			Such is the beginning of the end of the Iyadorian Queendom. 100 years ago, the ruling family was
			without a true queen, a queen blessed by the night. Patriarchal extremists had gained
			popularity throughout the Queendom. It seems the people were unhappy with the family's handling
			of a recent natural disaster. Extremists had pinned the failures of the government directly
			on the royal family. They invaded towns and cities, placing their own leaders in charge as they
			went. The royal family gradually lost control of their lands, until the extremists were on their
			doorstep. Night fell, and the extremists breached the palace gates. Facing insufficient resistance
			from the palace guards, they advanced until they reached the family. Without guards and without
			magic, the royal family could not resist as they were executed by the revolutionaries. Blood was
			spilled from all but one: the youngest daughter.
			
			She had escaped via a laundry slew and crept her way quietly out of the palace and off to safety.
			Wise beyond her years, she removed anyhting linking her to her family. All but the Iyadorian signet
			was destroyed, which she stashed away, and then she vanished.
			
			The daughter distanced herself from the palace, and turned up at a local orphanage. She was adopted
			by a squalid couple, put to indetured work, and lived out her youth as slave. She finally earned
			enough to buy her freedom, opened a cartographer's shop, and fell in love. She started a family
			under a new name: ___. On her deathbed, she told her daughter who she really was: an heir to the
			throne, but that she must keep it secret until the time comes to reclaim what was taken from them.
			The old woman passed, leaving the signet for the next generation of Iyadors.
			
			This cycle repeated for some time. Each daughter inherited the signet and the weight of the decision
			of when and how to reclaim their Queendom, each of them crushed by the realization that the blessing
			of the Night Goddess had skipped them, each of them losing more hope than the last. Until one fateful
			night, under the light of a full moon, Oseria was born. She grew quickly, but her mind grew quicker.
			She was a master cartographer by the age of 12. She was a skilled archer, a true prodigy. Her eyes
			were brighter and greyer than the moon itself. And one night, she even cast her first spell. Yes,
			the blessing of the Night Goddess had finally revealed itself again. Oseria was to be a powerful
			sorcerous.
			
			Oseria's mother was hesitant; while she was ecstatic that her daughter was blessed after all these
			years of skipped generations, she was terrified of what her daughter was destined to face. Oseria
			understood the need for discretion with her newfound powers. She was gifted the materials she needed
			to travel the lands, as well as the Iyadorian signet, and she bid farewell.
			
			Oseria traveled from town to town, city to city, carefully dismantling the extremists' system of
			control over the populous using her archery and her magic, inspiring hope in all those with whom she
			comes into contact. No one can claim to have seen her. No one even knows her name. She is only known
			by her moniker: The Wanderer.
